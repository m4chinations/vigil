#Vigil

Vigil is a browser extension that gives your browsing a rating based on three areas: privacy, security, and tracking If your browsing habits are secure, safe from prying eyes, and untraceable, you'll get a perfect score. But let's face it - your browsing habits are anything but that. Vigil shows you which connections you made were insecure, unsafe, or monitored, and provides suggestions to  remedy the problem. By following through with Vigil's suggestions, your online experience will be more private, protected, and confidential - and this sends a clear message to the bad actors: we're fighting back.

Vigil is inspired by Lightbeam, which was inspired by Collusion. Here is a TED talk on Collusion http://www.ted.com/talks/gary_kovacs_tracking_the_tracker
