Vigil

Vigil is a browser extension that gives your browsing a rating based on three
areas: privacy, security, and tracking. If your browsing habits are secure, safe
from prying eyes, and untraceable, you'll get a perfect score. But let's face it
- your browsing habits are anything but that. Vigil shows you which connections
you made were insecure, unsafe, or monitored, and provides suggestions to 
remedy the problem. By following through with Vigil's suggestions, your online
experience will be more private, protected, and confidential - and this sends a 
clear message to the bad actors: we won't consent to violations of our rights. 

Vigil was inspired by Lightbeam, which was inspired by Collusion. Here is a TED 
talk on Collusion (by past Moz CEO)
